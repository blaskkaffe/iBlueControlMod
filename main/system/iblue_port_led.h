/*
 * iBlueControlMod: the four controller port LEDs. Each has its own PWM channel (LEDC high speed
 * channels 4 to 7, timer 3), so one LED can fade without the others. They
 *  - fade in quickly when a controller connects and out when it goes (fast at first, slow at the
 *    end, so it looks logarithmic), never brighter than CONFIG_BLUERETRO_IBLUE_LED_MAX_PCT, and
 *  - show the drops-on-water animation while the BIOS boot animation plays.
 * The pairing pulse and the button-hold flash of system/manager.c still take a pin over by
 * connecting it to another LEDC signal; set() takes it back.
